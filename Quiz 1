#Quiz 1, R programming
#Question 4
#If I execute the expression x <- 4L in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?

#Question 5
#What is the class of the object defined by x <- c(4, TRUE)?

#Question 5
#If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression cbind(x, y)?

#Question 8
#Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[1]] give me?

#Question 9
#Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and a vector y <- 2. What is produced by the expression x + y?

#Question 10
#Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all 
#elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this?

#Question 11
#In the dataset provided for this Quiz, what are the column names of the dataset?

#Question 12
#Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

#Question 13
#How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?

#Question 14
#How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?

#Question 15
#What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?

#Q16
#What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?

#Q17
#What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation?

#Q18
#Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. 
#What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?

#Q19
#What is the mean of "Temp" when "Month" is equal to 6? 

#Q20
#What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month = 5)?
